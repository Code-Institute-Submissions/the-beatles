Hi all.

The first layout for this project I decided on is a simple conventional looking site with a title and navbar underneath which is all I have completed so far.

    The Markup is simple HTML and I've used CSS Flexbox as is my preference over Bootstrap but I may use Bootstrap yet.
    
    The title has 2 logos and a centred Heading.
    
    The navbar has 4 links so far and I've used transitions and hover effects with CSS3.
    
    I've included 2 section areas with the main section holding the images of the band members and the second section is using Bootstrap to create 3 columns with some additional information and the links to social media.
    
    The footer I've kept consistent with the color contrast.
    
    The "About" page is a fexbox container with 4 divs and I've used floats to wrap the text around the images inside the divs.
    
    
    That's it so far........nearly done!
    
    Having an issue uploading recent files to git hub in Cloud 9,It's not responding or saving changes and unable to update git files.
    
    Just cleared the Chrome cache and it seems to be working again.All good there.
    
    The "Media page" I have adjusted the width and height properties and also included a bootstrap class of 'container-fluid' to make it responsive.
    
    It contains some mp3 and iframe links to youtube videos.
    
    I also added "justify-content" to center the last video in the line to the center.....Worked pretty good!
    
    Finally I added the contact page with a basic form,again keeping within the color scheme.
