Hi all.

The first layout for this project I decided on is a simple conventional looking site with a title and navbar underneath which is all I have completed so far.

    The Markup is simple HTML and I've used CSS Flexbox as is my preference over Bootstrap but I may use Bootstrap yet.
    
    The title has 2 logos and a centred Heading.
    
    The navbar has 4 links so far and I've used transitions and hover effects with CSS3.
    
    I've included 2 section areas with the main section holding the images of the band members and the second section is using Bootstrap to create 3 columns with some additional information and the links to social media.
