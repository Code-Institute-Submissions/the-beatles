PROJECT TITLE:  Milestone Project 1:  "The BeaTles"


This is the project I've created as the first milestone project.I is based on 60's Rock Band 'The Beatles'.
It's main objective is to showcase the music and I included a media page with sample video and audio.

It was created using the technologies covered so far but I also used Flexbox as I prefer it to Bootstrap,although I did use it for 1 section on the Home Page.

My objective is to give the user an insight into who the Beatles were/are,to showcase their music and to make it as useful on mobile devices as it is on desktops.

I drew up a basic pen and paper version as to how the site would eventually look and feel.I decided on three main colors,Gray and Black background mixed with Red and White text.

This project is aimed at people who want to find out more about the beatles in the 60's,sample their music and book them for special events and partys etc.



The eventual layout for this project I decided on is a simple conventional looking site with a title and navbar underneath.

    The Markup is simple HTML5 and I've used CSS3 and Flexbox.
    
    The title has 2 logos and a centred Heading.
    
    I tried using Bootstrap but didn't like it so I went with my own idea.
    
    The navbar has 4 links and I've used transitions and hover effects with CSS3.
    
    I've included 2 section areas with the main section holding the images of the band members and the second section is using Bootstrap to create 3 columns with some additional information and the links to social media.
    
    The footer I've kept consistent with the color contrast.
    
    The "About" page is a fexbox container with 4 divs and I've used floats to wrap the text around the images inside the divs.This is to give an overview of the band members.I kept the social links and the footer the same on all pages.
    
    The "Media page" I have adjusted the width and height properties and also included a bootstrap class of 'container-fluid' to make it responsive.
    
    It contains some mp3 and iframe links to youtube videos.
    
    I also added "justify-content" to center the last video in the line to the center.....Worked pretty good!
    
    Finally I added the contact page with a basic form,again keeping within the color scheme and font family.
    
    It's taken quite a while to finish because it took a whie to decide on the design and layout and my main concern was making it as responsive as I possible.
    
    
    TECHNOLOGIES USED:
    
    HTML5,CSS3,FLEXBOX and BOOTSTRAP.
    
    
    
    I've tested this project every step of the way using developer tools to make sure it's as responsive as possible.
    
    Then I made a final test just to make sure links were working and everything looked like my design plan.
